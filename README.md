# Data-Driven Documents

**D3.js** is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. **D3** helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

## D34Raphael

This branch is for working on and contributing to [D34Raphael](http://webmonarch.github.com/d34raphael/). So far, here I've implemented:

* Class assignment and selection for Raphael elements
    * Uses Sizzle for selection when appropriate
* selection.remove()
* Basic (attr) transitions
